# GradeCraft: Predictive Modeling for Online Learning Success. (Preprocessing, visualization, decision making based on insights)
Predicting grades from the given dataset is 
the primary goal of this project. Data was 
taken from Moodle. Some data visualization 
was performed to understand data. I 
employed two different predicting models, 
Linear Regression and Random Forest. In 
addition to this, I served preprocessing and 
compared the accuracy results before and 
after preprocessing.
